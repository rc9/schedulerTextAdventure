We created a text adventure game called “EPIC Text Adventure”. From the game introduction:

“Your goal as a CS student is to complete a Prolog project and get an A+.
You, of course, needed a challenge and so chose to undertake building a scheduler that would be the envy of the entire class!
You did not foresee the difficulties however, and are having quite a bit of trouble.
With not much time left, you desperately explore your world searching for any hints you can find so you can "write code" that will work.
How much advice do you need? Who knows? Better start hunting!”

Start up prolog and load the epicTextAdventure file in the textGame directory.
